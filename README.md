## üöÄ What This Repository Covers

- Node.js fundamentals
- Working with core modules
- Creating servers with native `http` and Express
- File and path handling
- RESTful APIs and CRUD
- Templating engines
- Connecting MongoDB
- MVC pattern basics

## üì¶ Node Modules

To avoid bloating the repo, all `node_modules` directories are ignored using `.gitignore`.

To run any project:
1. Navigate to that folder:
   ```bash
   cd Lecture_07_Express
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Run the app:
   node app.js

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Node.js
Express
MongoDB (for DB-related lectures)
EJS (for templating)
Postman (for testing APIs)

üìö Why this Repo?
This is my personal learning lab where I experimented and practiced Node.js concepts step by step. It‚Äôs meant to help me and others understand how Node.js works by building from basic to slightly advanced examples.
